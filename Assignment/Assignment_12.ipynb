      "To begin with, what forms the starting point or source of all the data flowing into Power BI components are the data sources. Power BI has the get data feature using which you can connect to different kinds of data sources like files, on-premise or on-cloud databases, direct connections, etc. Data connections are established from these data sources to authoring tools such as Power BI Desktop.\n",

Like a complete Power BI suite having dataflows, datasets, dashboards, reports, Power BI Embedded, Power BI Premium, etc. You can embed your reports and dashboards into Teams, SharePoint, custom applications, etc. There are on-cloud data sources as well that connects to Power BI tools via direct connections.\n",

      "At last, there is a layer of authenticated users who share the published reports and dashboard and collaborate with one another to make educated decisions based on the insights.

      "\n",
